# Debugging Recipe Template

Fill in this [debugging recipe](https://hackmd.io/@brown-csci0320/BJKCtyxxs) template when you're debugging at collab hours. Use it to populate an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) in your repository on Github. Follow the instructions in the [debugging recipe](https://hackmd.io/@brown-csci0320/BJKCtyxxs) for each piece of the template. If you reach the end and repeat the process for the same bug, don't fill in a new template; just add text in the appropriate places.
